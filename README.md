## About the Research
This research project is sponsored by the Undergraduate Research Support Scheme of the University of Warwick, aiming to investigate the causal impacts of the EU Emissions Trading System on consumption inequality. By employing econometric identification stratefy such as a DID framework, this work contributes to the critical discourse on environmental economics and equity. This repository not only hosts the full paper but also the code used in the analysis, offering a transparent view of the research process.
